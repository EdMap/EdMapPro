  --- Chatting with Marcus (Tech Lead) ---
  [USER]: Hey! I'm the new developer starting today. Nice to meet you!
  [Marcus]: Hey, welcome to NovaPay! I'm Marcus, a Senior Developer here. Nice to meet you too! I'll be one of the people helping you get up to speed. What do you think of the onboarding plan for today - meeting the team, setting up your dev environment, and exploring the codebase?
  [USER] (curious): That sounds like a solid plan to me - I'm excited to meet the team and get started on setting up my dev environment. Can you tell me a bit more about what I can expect from the team and the codebase, and what I should focus on learning first?
  [Marcus]: The team is pretty collaborative, and we're all about writing maintainable code. As for the codebase, it's a bit complex since we're dealing with payment processing, but don't worry, we'll break it down for you. I think it'd be helpful to start with our tech stack - we use a mix of Node, Express, and MongoDB. What do you know about these technologies so far?
  [USER] (brief): I'm pretty familiar with Node.js and React, but I've never worked with Express or MongoDB before, so I'm excited to learn.
  [Marcus]: No worries, we can definitely get you up to speed on Express and MongoDB. Express is a popular framework for Node, and we use it to handle routing and middleware in our Merchant Dashboard. MongoDB is our database of choice for storing transaction data and analytics. I can share some resources with you later to help you get started, but for now, let's focus on getting your dev environment set up. Have you had a chance to look at the setup instructions we provided?
  [USER] (brief): Yeah, I actually just started reading through the instructions, I'll make sure to get my dev environment set up as soon as possible so I can dive into learning more about the tech stack.
  [Marcus]: That's a great start. While you're setting up your dev environment, I'll share some tips on what to focus on first. We have a few key dependencies that need to be installed, so make sure to follow the instructions carefully. If you run into any issues, don't hesitate to reach out - we've all been there before. How's your familiarity with command line interfaces, by the way?
  [USER] (wrapping_up): I feel pretty comfortable with command line interfaces, I've used them in my previous projects and courses, especially in setting up and managing Node.js projects.
  [Marcus]: That's awesome to hear. With your Node.js experience, you'll likely pick up our setup process quickly. One thing to keep in mind is that we use a custom script to simplify the setup process, so be sure to run that script as instructed in the setup guide. It'll save you some time and ensure everything is configured correctly.

================================================================================

  --- Chatting with Marcus (Tech Lead) ---
  [USER]: Hey! I'm the new developer starting today. Nice to meet you!
  [Marcus]: Hey, welcome to NovaPay. Nice to meet you too. I'm Marcus, one of the senior devs here. I'll be helping you get settled in. What's your first impression of our codebase so far, or are you still setting up your dev environment?
  [USER] (curious): I'm still setting up my dev environment, but I've started browsing through the codebase. I noticed you guys are using a combination of Node.js and React, which I'm familiar with, but I'm not sure about the specific frameworks and libraries you're using.
  [Marcus]: We use Express.js as our Node.js framework, and for React, we've adopted Redux for state management. We've also incorporated some other libraries like GraphQL and Apollo Client for API interactions. I can give you a more detailed overview of our tech stack if you'd like, or we can discuss it more during our pairing session later this week.
  [USER] (curious): That's really helpful to know, thanks for clarifying the tech stack. You mentioned we're using GraphQL and Apollo Client for API interactions - can you tell me more about why you chose those libraries specifically and how they fit into our overall architecture?
  [Marcus]: We chose GraphQL and Apollo Client to simplify our API interactions and reduce the amount of data being transferred. With GraphQL, we can query only the data we need, which has significantly improved performance. Apollo Client helps us manage caching and optimistic updates, making our app more responsive. I can share some examples from our codebase to illustrate how we've implemented it, if you're interested?
  [USER] (wrapping_up): Thanks so much for explaining that to me, Marcus - it's really helpful to understand the reasoning behind our tech stack. I think I'm starting to get a better sense of how everything fits together.
