# 🧩 Product Requirement Document (PRD)

**Product Name:** Customer Support Simulator
**Product Owner:** Arsen Asatryan
**Platform:** Web-based simulation product (Replit-hosted MVP)
**Target Users:** Aspiring and junior customer support agents
**Primary Goal:** Help users gain realistic experience by simulating conversations (chat or voice) with AI-driven clients in different stages of customer support

---

## 🧭 1. Problem Statement

Many aspiring or new customer support agents struggle with real-world readiness. They lack exposure to real customer scenarios, emotional responses, pressure situations, and the structured nature of support workflows. Existing training is either theoretical or outdated.

---

## 🎯 2. Objectives

* Let users practice real-time conversations with simulated clients (chat or voice).
* Provide stage-based training (e.g., greeting, issue resolution, escalation).
* Offer customizable personas for clients (e.g., angry, confused, elderly).
* Track and analyze performance to improve soft and problem-solving skills.

---

## 🧑‍💻 3. Core Features

### A. Simulation Launcher

* **Flow:**

  1. User lands on homepage.
  2. Selects:

     * **Support channel:** `Chat` or `Call`
     * **Stage of support:** `Greeting`, `Problem Diagnosis`, `Resolution`, `Escalation`, `Closing`
     * **Client persona:** Predefined personas (`Angry customer`, `Polite customer`, `Elderly`, `Confused`, etc.) or custom persona prompt.
  3. Clicks **"Start Simulation"**

### B. Client Persona Builder

* Users can choose from:

  * Predefined personas
  * Input their own persona description (e.g., "a sarcastic, impatient 40-year-old who lost access to their email")

### C. AI-Driven Client Simulation

* **Chat Mode:**

  * Real-time chat interface
  * Messages appear with human-like delay
* **Call Mode (MVP):**

  * Text-to-speech and speech-to-text integration (e.g., using Web APIs or Replicate’s Whisper & TTS models)
  * Simulate real call experience in-browser

### D. Feedback & Analytics

* After each simulation:

  * Breakdown by:

    * Empathy score
    * Clarity
    * Resolution attempt quality
    * Escalation judgment
  * LLM-generated feedback with quotes from the session
  * Optional replay of chat/call

### E. User Dashboard

* Session history
* Progress tracker per stage (e.g., novice → intermediate → advanced)
